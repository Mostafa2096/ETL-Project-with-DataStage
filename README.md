# ETL-Project-with-DataStage

This Project is dedicated to optimizing ETL processes with a specialized focus on crafting efficient pipelines for data extraction, transformation, and loading.

## Project Overview

My recent endeavor involved spearheading a transformative project within the retail domain, centered around the implementation of a star-schema data warehousing flow.

## Key Activities

During this project, I initiated by executing the ETL process, seamlessly extracting data from the OLTP system, implementing crucial transformations, and subsequently loading the refined data into the Retail_Data_Mart. 

Leveraging IBM InfoSphere DataStage, I proceeded to conduct comprehensive analyses on the established data mart, addressing pivotal business inquiries and deriving actionable insights.
